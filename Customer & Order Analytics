#In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

#OR 

SELECT distinct product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT product, sum(Quantity)*price as revenue

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity)*price FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c ON c.order_id = f.orderID

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
